# Comparison-of-Regression-Models-for-Electricity-Consumption-Prediction
This project forecasts electricity consumption using machine learning models trained on historical energy generation data. It employs Random Forest, Linear Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict daily grid load. The code includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of result
